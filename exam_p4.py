"""
What is the most interesting/funny/cool thing(s) about Python that you learned from this class or from somewhere else.

You can use code or a short paragraph to illustrate it.


One of the coolest things I have learned and find super advantageous is the object oriented programming.
The reason why I think it is cool is its flexibility to change and reuse code. What I mean by that is that 
we do not have to retype the code multiple times, and if a module needs to be changed, it will not affect
the entirety of the code. Another interesting aspect of OOP is its classes and subclasses. OOP makes 
it much easier to see the relationship between everything. Something equally as cool is the turtle module.
At first I was having trouble understanding how to use the module, but the more familiar I got, the cooler 
it became. I was able to create the ying yang picture and the flower with code. I never knew I would be 
able to do that.
